why such a big html page?
Why inline css?

Why do you need jquery.min.js when you already gave a link to ajax.googleapis.com
no need
not required
wrong idea
you could have used angular js to include all the css files

Body and html again?

you could have used many variables rather than having such a big string
U dont need this function as we are using angular js modals
these are not required those are some random pages..which are yet to be implemented

u have given random pages in href
such a big string?
you dont need this, we already implemented it in shift.js
wrong implementation
1 and 5 are same not properly hardcoded
Why Inline Css??

Inline script ?
too many linkages,
unnecessary links used 
unnecessary opening & closing script tags......
empty script ?
why closing head tag here ?
we already closed it 
Can be implemented in a better way
This approach would be make our  integration difficult..
not needed
Remove spaces in between the names for each json
you might have used another txt file to store these instructions.These are not  appropriate here.

No proper comments on how the servlets are being mapped

inline css
string too big for hardcoding
I think it would be more user friendly if this form generation is more efficient.There are no glowing and un glowing.There are no tabs and windows.
remove unnecessary code
remove redundant code
Spaces should be removed in the object variables
"?" should be removed from all variables as this would return error while creating json string from these
Remove this testing.
This would go on like this..Better  get an efficient code for this as there are so many inputs ,outputs and transform steps
Better get this download working.This makes the download file just in your pc.
This is no need of iteration of degree 100 as the data driven components we implemented are only few 
Instead of writing for each and every step, this can be implemented by giving it an global condition for the Stepnames and their inner implementation of if-else loop.(i.e To be Generalised)
