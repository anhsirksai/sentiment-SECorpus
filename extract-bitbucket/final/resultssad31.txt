U have unused functions like conf in bdry2.dat 
In Task.txt you can try for higher frequencies also as for higher frequencies walls expand.
does not work for higher frequency
It should be continuous  for all particles i.e there should be no pause command  
SO many ii=out(.....). Since user will not be able to see it on console hence no use of printing.
We need to load and unload the sample.So this should not be commented
Cycle of length hundred is not sufficient for getting actual behavior of particles.So increase the number of cycles for proper analysis.

there is an error in the output graph  

Unused function as radius function is not getting called anywhere
We don't need two cycle.Only one was enough

more comments to be added for better understandibility

Gravity should not be used for compressing the balls instead of this wall should be compressed and radius of balls should be increased.
Function name used should be relevant according to their use to increase readability and for better understanding
The boundary particles are not being fixed . So alter the above condition accordingly.
Record changes for larger range of porosity values for better understanding.
