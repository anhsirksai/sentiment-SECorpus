would have been better if named varibles used
like foreach y_coordinate in y_data
instead of i and j
explanation for $tableContents and $x , $y initialised to be NULL
improper indentation
title should have been passed as function parameter. Text 'Total Fruit consumption' used. so,view helper can't be  generalised for bar stacked column graph.
Explanation about fontWeight needed.
name should have been passed as function parameters (as an array). name declared in helper only so it can't be generalised as view helper . 
array should have been passed as variable rather than passing it to graph function in braces' format
div id should have been passed as function argument.
few arguments are taken because the phtml file is not available.This is a helper only for testing.
$x is the parameters present in the x-axis and $y for y-axis,argument names would be fixed

as this for testing only it is kept NULL, the phml file from which the graph is actually called is not available
improper variable t,regstr,contowag names used
improper indentation
improper indentation
logs improper variable name for data
test data should have been from the database
t is just a temporary log , regstr--number of registrations,contowag-->conversion to wagerers
need to be implemented.
why is $totalCount==7 ?? 
$reconsilation['reconsilation'] .. variables names matches with json entry/variable used in database. Should have been different for keeping proper track of function
json_encoding and json_decoding is done.why is encoding done if you are using decoded form of json?

title of x-axis and y-axis should have been passed as function parameters,rather fixed title text has been used.so,cant be used as generalized view helper.
what is pointInterval??
title of x-axis as DateTime is appropriate as view helper applies to date time graph only
need explanation about marker
text might have been taken as an argument

Indentation error

already ordered accoring to id
Why is this declared to null?
making sure that array dont contain any dummy values before I can insert player ids in it

It was not made sure that it was ordered according to player ids
but you already inserted played ids why make it null after that?
you ordered the arrayId to have player ids in order so when you are querying they are already ordered its not required to order again.
redeclaring a module Zenfox_Query::create in the same scope could have been avoided
please explain why a null argument is passed

indentation error
variable names could have been proper and explanatory 
variables like dummy and dat are not proper
please comment on implode function
Null arguments are passed
