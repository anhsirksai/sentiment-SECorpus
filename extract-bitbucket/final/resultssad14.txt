Inline comments are bad practice. Clean up the view, and move all inline styling to style.css in a later revision. 
Maybe a good idea to nest the jQuery for the initial states in one $(document).ready() block.
When you use an empty div with the clearfix class, you're clearing the empty div. Which kind of works, but kills the point of the clearfix. Apply clearfix as a class directly to the tag you want to clear. You can even use multiple classes on a tag, if you like. Like this — 

<a class="something clearfix">aa</a>
None of the <div>s with the 'clearfix' class hav been implmented by us. These were already present in the html file that we received from the client.
Aren't forms supposed to be declared before they are used?
How are we storing attendees in a string? How about a relational database, using the — class Model(...)extends AnotherModel that scala provides? Its simple. 

Edit: A quick google search indicates this behavior comes from the Activate Persistence Framework. It's an ORM that would make our backend (and our lives) much easier. Wide support. 



For the staging server, we will have to use Env Variables to configure the Database URL. Make an if-construct that checks for the env variable, and uses the default only if it does not exist. 
Looks fine. We should have a script to manage Database migrations, though. Nice work, guys!
javascript should be included in separate js file and include it for better modularity
html files of client should be properly indented maybe using online editor
totally agreed
Is this script able to retrieve information in Json form from db. Also the code is not understandable.So please write comments.
**form validation** at this place needs to be done #important
**close the files and then push**. There are some files which are ending with ~ showing that the main file was not closed before pushing.
There is only one html file, that is, 'index.html'. Supposed to be two. 

Maybe send the details of joining through post request.
Comments missing
Agreed we will take care of these points.
You should avoid using global variables and use closure property.
No spacing before or after operator.
Why are the javascript files and the html files in the same directory??
Use 'em' or '%' instead of 'px' for a responsive page. 'em' would be a better choice when the various sizes are to be set relative to the default font size set in the browser. And, use '%', when the page needs to adapt according to the screen size of the device. 
Shouldn't the organizer be the default presenter (according to the specifications given to us)??
Isn't there any "Organizer" 'userType' (should be according to the specifications)??
