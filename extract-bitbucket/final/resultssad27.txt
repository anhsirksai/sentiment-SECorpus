Unneccessary properties of left, top and right as they are just assigned to *"0dp"* .
Unneccessary items in the actionbar_menu should be removed.

**Note:** It has been changed in the next commit.
The minSdkVersion has to be reduced to a smaller value (eg: 8), so that the app can be installed in phones having lower version of Android. This also means that the app should be made compatible with lower versions of Android.
If android:left, right and top values are equal to "0dp", then it is **not necessary** to mention them explicitly under the <item> tag.
Instead of naming the drawable resource as *login_button_ui2*, it should have been named as *login_button_ui_pressed* , as it is a more meaning full name which also shows the drawable resource's purpose.
It is an **unneccessary** XML file, as it is not used anywhere. Also *MyApplication.java* is just a class and not an activity, and hence does not have any XML view.
The style of the text could have been done in the styles.xml that could have reduced the amount of code by giving it as a resource to all text having similar font type or color.
The layout could be made in a super layout say linear and could give it padding which would be reflected for all other XML components inside the layout minimizing code.
Password should be encrypted  for security purpose.This should definitely be resolved.
Good change ! Since the entire app only works in portrait orientation, *android:screenOrientation="portrait"* has been added to all the activities in the Manifest file.
As a convention, it is always better to make textSize >= 12sp . Also the textSize should always be in *"sp"* and not in *"dp"*.
Instead of prompting up for the installing scanner, better we get an inbuilt scanner so that it wouldn't be problematic for the user.
Good work ! Adding *scaleType="fitXY"* helps a lot in fitting large images into a limited smaller space.
Better use instances names which define both file and purpose of it as these are more commonly used.
Verification of user details in nicely done.Solves the purpose of unique identity of user without leaving any case behind.
nice to use units sp for all text sizes and dp for else, because and we know the reason for this is to respect a 'user's preferences'.
Better consult the one making java files in giving ids in to later avoid the conflicting situation in later part though nice work.
Nice Layout ! Good work done in showing Restaurant details.

**Error:**
Multiple use of *id/address* in the XML. 
It has been corrected in the next commit !!
Good use of **largeHeap**, as more runtime memory will be allocated to the app !
Hopefully more tabs will be added in the future !
Whenever a layout is added inside a *<ScrollView>* , its *layout_height* should always be *wrap_content* and not *fill_parent* .
nice to use focusable rather to clickable, as  it can gain the focus even from an input device like a keyboard.
The time obtained is in UTC format in the stamp history and has to be changed to users location based time.
Better to reduce the nested if-else conditions, so that number of edges in the flow graph may decrease, so that there will be less **cyclomatic complexity**
It's nice to use try and catch here and there often, better way to debug with such a large code.
Performing and assigning values to an instance in a line makes it troublesome to understand.
Unused variable TAG !
The declaration can be removed.
The semicolon is present without any statement. Though its does not cause errors, it is totally unnecessary !
Very bad indentation makes the above 14 lines of code very difficult to read and understand ! This should be corrected .
Better to reduce number of calls to other classes, so that there will be less coupling between the classes.
In case the image is not uploaded on the server side it starts repeating on every card after 4th stamp card. So its better to display no image of store.
Wrong spelling of expiryDate, please change all the spellings in the entire java file.
