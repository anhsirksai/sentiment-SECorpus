change Max-limit of year to "2014" or "present year"
No need to use helper_method every where. 
It's needed for long lists or options in 'views'
This is used for Date of Birth so there's no need to change the Max-limit to "2014"
Use "or" Operation than if condition 
'if' statement needs an 'end'. Please run the code or test it before pushing.
Instead of multiple "If" conditions use flags for each attributes.  
All the 'if', 'end', can be clubbed into one single query from the database based on the value of the variables -> location, language and caste.
What do you mean by 'flags' ? Wouldn't the if condition still remain ?
Error handling ? interest_by could be nil
Same here
Does not matter. A ''.split(',') gives output as an empty array []
undefined method `split' for nil:NilClass check the error ??

Fixed it now. Thanks for pointing that out.
when going from profile to either interest shown by or interest shown to,
the params are http://localhost:3000/user_profile/interest_shown_by which is giving error "Couldn't find User with 'id'=0"
just check one how are you routing and check the controller too
the params should be-
just: http://localhost:3000/interest_shown_by
no need to use of '+' in this case

What are you talking about?
That's not in the code.
oh sry i thought it was in the code :P
no use to remove commented part :)
