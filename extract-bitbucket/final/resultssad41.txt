css part and nav bar part should be implemented .

There is no css part in this page
For District,mandal,village instead of both 'select one' and 'add new' simply keeping input value is better.
better css

include nav.php instead of header_new.php
Nav bars not working for most pages
Css must be upadated for them also.
i think that thing is fixed for most of pages but the nav bar css part should be changed
css part of these files should be changed.It doesn't look well!
CSS part is not good as the display  varies w.r.t size of desktop.
better use "nav.php" instead of "header_new.php"

Update CSS for "ceo" navbar
Update CSS for "manager" navbar

Update CSS for "expert" navbar

Update CSS for "super expert" navbar
Update CSS for "partner" navbar
